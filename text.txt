Aristocrat Leisure Ltd
Update to credit analysis
Summary
Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's (“Aristocrat”, Ba1 stable) credit profile reflects its strong market
presence and distribution across a diversified geographical footprint, as well as its history of
developing products that continue to prove popular amongst consumers. The credit profile
also reflects the shift in revenue mix towards recurring revenue and earnings stability from
significant organic growth in the premium gaming operations and digital businesses, but also
earnings from recent acquisitions.
On 15th May 2023, the company announced the proposed acquisition of 100% of
NeoGames S.A. (“NeoGames”, unrated) for approximately AUD1.8 billion. Should the
proposed transaction go ahead, Aristocrat's business profile will improve from increased scale
and geographic diversification, and new complementary growth channels through its real
money gaming segment (“RMG”). The transaction remains subject to NeoGames shareholder
approval, as well as gaming regulatory, antitrust and foreign investment approvals. The
company expects the transaction will be completed during FY2024 (end 30 September
2024), and will be funded with cash on hand.

Credit Strengths
» Strong organic growth across most segments
» Improving earnings stability from the shift towards recurring revenue
» Previous acquisitions in the Pixel United improve diversification
» Solid financial metrics
Credit Challenges
» Expansion in real money gaming (RMG) could increase execution risk and growth spending, including potential material acquisitions
» Evolving competitive conditions heighten importance of continued innovation. This is exacerbated by Pixel United, in which
products can very quickly become obsolete
» Evolving nature of regulatory oversight of the sector and consumer tastes
» The potential for future capital management initiatives
Rating Outlook
» The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the company’s credit metrics will remain within rating tolerance thresholds over the
next 12-18 months.
Factors that Could Lead to an Upgrade
» We could upgrade the rating if the company commits to a financial policy in line with an investment-grade rating, which would
include maintaining adjusted debt/EBITDA below 2.0x on a sustained basis.
» An upgrade to investment grade would also require Aristocrat transitioning to a fully unsecured capital structure.
Factors that Could Lead to a Downgrade
» A deterioration in operating conditions or acquisitions that cause leverage to increase and/or liquidity to weaken to levels below our
expectations for the rating.
» Specifically, debt/EBITDA sustained above 3.0x would likely lead to a downgrade.

Detailed Rating Considerations
Proposed acquisition of NeoGames will improve business profile
On 15 May 2023, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd (”Aristocrat”) announced the proposed acquisition of NeoGames S.A. (”NeoGames”).
NeoGames is a content and solutions provider for the online Real Money Gaming (”RMG”) industry, including content, proprietary
technology platforms and value-added services across iLottery, iGaming and Online Sports Betting. NeoGames has over 200 customers
in over 50 regulated markets.
Should the proposed transaction go ahead, we expect Aristocrat's business profile will benefit from added scale, incremental earnings
and geographic diversity as it grows its online RMG segment globally in North America, as well as Europe and Rest of World markets.
Although we expect the initial earnings contribution to be moderate (NeoGames' EBITDA in FY2022 (December 2022) was AUD88
3 20 June 2023 Aristocrat Leisure Ltd: Update to credit analysis
MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE CORPORATES
million), the proposed acquisition will allow Aristocrat to enter the fast growing RMG segment, and the highly regulated iLottery
market.
The transaction remains subject to NeoGames shareholder approval, as well as gaming regulatory, antitrust and foreign investment
approvals. The company expects the transaction will be completed during FY2024 (end 30 September 2024).
However, we expect there could be potential integration and execution challenges with the acquisition. We do note however, that
Aristocrat has a good track record with integrating acquisitions including Roxor Gaming in 2022, Big Fish in 2018 and Plarium in 2017.
We also estimate that the proposed transaction will not materially impact Aristocrat's credit metrics, as the company will fund the
transaction - including transaction fees - with existing cash balances. Aristocrat will purchase 100% of NeoGames for a cash price of
USD29.50 per share which implies an enterprise value of USD1.2 billion (AUD1.8 billion).
We expect earnings to remain strong from an improvement in Land Based earnings, and moderate earnings growth from
Pixel United
Aristocrat’s first half fiscal 2023 results reflected a solid improvement in earnings across the North American Gaming operations
combined with a strong revenue contribution from global Outright sales segment. We expect Aristocrat’s Land Based segment will
continue to improve over the next 12-18 months, driven by continued penetration of the company's high performing games and
hardware. We also expect continued strong performance in the company's Outright Sales business, as the company expands into
adjacent segments in North America.
We also expect revenues from Pixel United will continue to grow at a modest pace, benefitting from the continued scaling of new
games and ongoing portfolio investment. We estimate Aristocrat's cash flow from operations will be more than adequate to cover our
expectation of elevated design and development costs to support scaling of this portfolio.

Increased recurring revenue has improved earnings stability
Aristocrat's revenue has been largely recurring in nature over the past 6 years, with a significant contribution from Pixel United and
Aristocrat's strategy to reduce volatility in outright sales based earnings. We expect the successful establishment of RMG segment to
provide additional recurring revenue.

Source: Company reports
Notwithstanding the inherent risks of changing consumer tastes in both Digital gaming and gaming operations products, increased
recurring revenue is positive for earnings stability and reduces reliance on more volatile platform sales.
Business profile benefits from geographic diversity
Aristocrat's geographic diversity reduces its exposure to unfavorable economic trends in any specific market. A significant proportion
of revenues are now derived from the US particularly following strong growth in its Class II and Class III segments as well as from past
acquisitions. The company's significant increases in revenue and earnings from its Pixel United division also increase the diversity of its
geographic operations globally. Following the growth in Pixel United, Aristocrat’s business benefits from earnings across 102 countries,
albeit the US, and to a lessor degree Australia, are still the largest contributors.
Aristocrat operates in a highly regulated sector, with rules and licencing requirements varying by jurisdiction – which also represents
a barrier to entry. The company's good geographic diversity is a mitigant to this risk as it helps to ensure that a reduction in cash flow
from a particular jurisdiction due to a regulatory change should be manageable.
Regulatory changes may also benefit the business through facilitating churn of existing installations. This diversity may be of limited
value in the unlikely event that Aristocrat breaches a regulation in a particular jurisdiction, because it may lead to licence reviews and/
or cancellations in other jurisdictions. Furthermore, significant adverse regulatory changes regarding the monetization of its social
casino gaming business would negatively impact the expected growth in its Digital division.
Evolving competitive conditions emphasize importance of continuing innovation
The gaming sector is competitive and characterized by companies having to continually invest in new products to maintain player
interest, which is fundamental to generating product sales to casinos and consistent revenue from Land Based and Digital businesses.
Aristocrat's rating is supported by its track record, established under its current management, of product innovation and creating
growth niches through market segmentation initiatives. These insights have allowed the business to grow its overall market share
whilst increasing selling prices, an important consideration in view of the mature state of its main markets. Aristocrat's ability to
continue generating sales growth and maintain margins has enabled it to generate sufficient free cash flow to continue investing in new
content to maintain its market position and reduce debt post funding of acquisitions.
Design and Development (D&D) is a key capital allocation priority and required to achieve and maintain significant recurring sales. In
the first half of fiscal 2023, Aristocrat spent around 12% of its revenue, or AUD372 million, on D&D. We expect that Aristocrat will
continue to spend in excess of 10% on D&D and also prioritise investments in user acquisitions (UA) to drive growth.
The mature state of the market and competition from other forms of entertainment for discretionary income - particularly for the
younger demographic group - underscores the need for continuing innovation to develop new titles to maintain player interest. This in
5 20 June 2023 Aristocrat Leisure Ltd: Update to credit analysis
MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE CORPORATES
turn should translate into continued demand for products from casinos and encourage churn out of older titles into new ones, which
benefits product sales.
However, continued new product development will mean that Aristocrat will likely have a higher reliance on key individuals for
intellectual property development than other consumer oriented sectors.
Financial leverage to remain comfortable within our tolerance level but shareholder returns and growth spending are likely
to increase
We expect the company’s leverage – as measured by Moody’s adjusted debt/EBITDA – will improve to around 1.1x–1.3x in the next
12-18 months from around 1.3x as at March 2023. While we expect earnings will continue to improve over the next 12-18 months,
which could drive further deleveraging, we also believe the company will continue to focus on growth, particularly in its RMG segment,
and could look at inorganic opportunities which could delay or make temporary more material deleveraging.
We also factor in the headroom available at the current rating level to accommodate some deterioration in earnings and/or
shareholder initiatives. Given the high cash balances after the failed Playtech bid, we expect the company could look at material
shareholder returns absent further inorganic opportunities.
ESG considerations
Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's ESG Credit Impact Score is Moderately Negative CIS-3
Exhibit 7
ESG Credit Impact Score
Source: Moody's Investors Service
Aristocrat’s ESG Credit Impact Score is moderately negative (CIS-3). ESG attributes have limited credit impact today but have the
potential to pressure Aristocrat’s ratings over time. Aristocrat has neutral to low environmental risk exposure but has highly negative
social risk exposure. The company’s conservative financial strategy and risk management and established track record support its
neutral to low governance risk.

Social
Aristocrat is exposed to changing demographic and societal trends. Aristocrat does not have as much direct interaction with end
gaming consumers, but its products must help its gaming provider customers mitigate the risks of activities such as money laundering,
problem gambling, and data protection. Although, gaming remains a popular source of entertainment, Aristocrat faces social
responsibility pressures, as well as the potential for consumer preferences to move in a direction that does not favor traditional casino
gaming including slot machines that comprise a significant share of the company’s revenue. The company’s Pixel United operations
partially mitigate this risk.
Governance
Aristocrat has maintained conservative financial policies and excellent liquidity for an extended period. Management has demonstrated
a strong track record of credibility and continually meets, or outperforms, on its earnings and growth targets.
ESG Issuer Profile Scores and Credit Impact Scores for the rated entity/transaction are available on Moodys.com. In order to view the
latest scores, please click here to go to the landing page for the entity/transaction on MDC and view the ESG Scores section.
Liquidity Analysis
Aristocrat has a strong liquidity profile. Aristocrat's business model is characterized by strong free cash flow generation and is therefore
intrinsically supportive of its liquidity position. This reflects the high EBITDA margins and its cash flow from operations being more than
adequate to cover design and development expenditure.
As at 31 March 2023, Aristocrat had around AUD2.7 billion in cash and equivalents available and the full AUD738 million available
under its revolving credit facility. At the same time, Aristocrat increased its on-market share buy-back program by up to AUD500
million, to a total of AUD1.5 billion, and the program will run up to 31 May 2024.
We expect Aristocrat will maintain its strong liquidity despite cash balances decreasing to AUD600-700 million, after the company has
paid AUD1.8 billion for the NeoGames acquisition and AUD500 million for the share buy-back.
The company's next major maturity will be the USD1.30 billion Term Loan A facility and USD500 million senior secured revolver, which
mature in 2027.
Rating Methodology and Scorecard Factors
In assigning Aristocrat's ratings, we have referenced our Global Business and Consumer Services methodology. The differential between
the indicated rating from the scorecard and the assigned rating reflects Aristocrat's secured debt capital structure, as well as the cyclical
and competitive nature of the industry in which Aristocrat operates and the mature state of most of its end-markets, which may be
adversely affected by rapid changes in consumer preferences.

MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred
